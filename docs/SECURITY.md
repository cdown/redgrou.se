# Security policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in redgrou.se, please report it
privately rather than opening a public issue.

You can e-mail me at security [at] chrisdown.name

I aim to respond within 48 hours and will work with you to understand and
address the issue promptly.

## What to include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional but appreciated)

## Recognition

As a thank you for responsible disclosure, I'm happy to send you one of my bird
photography calendars for that year. Just let me know your postal address when
reporting.

## Scope

This policy covers:

- The redgrou.se web application
- The backend API
- Any official deployment infrastructure

Out of scope:

- Third-party services (OpenFreeMap, iNaturalist API)
- Issues in dependencies (please report those upstream, though do let me know)
